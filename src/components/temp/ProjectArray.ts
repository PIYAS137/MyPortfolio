        question:"What is the color coding theory of a resistor?",
        ans:"Components and wires are coded with colors to identify their value and function. Resistor Color Coding uses colored bands to quickly identify a resistors resistive value and its percentage of tolerance with the physical size of the resistor indicating its wattage rating.",
